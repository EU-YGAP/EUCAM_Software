EUCAM Software is a user-friendly tool aimed at simplifying the process of calculating potential output and output gap estimates, using the EU's commonly agreed,
production function methodology (henceforth referred to as the EUCAM i.e. the EU's Commonly Agreed Methodology).

In terms of policy use, potential output and output gap estimates are essential for assessing the productive (supply side) capacity and the cyclical (demand side)
positions of all of the EU's economies. They are estimated by DG ECFIN, using the transparent EUCAM rules as agreed by the Economic Policy Committee0s Output Gap
Working Group and the EPC and endorsed by the ECOFIN Council.

The estimates are applied in the framework of various economic and fiscal surveillance processes. More speciffically, the output gap indicator is used to cyclically
adjust the budget balances of the Member States (i.e. to produce their structural budget balances) and the potential output indicator is used for assessing debt 
sustainability and for comparing EU economies' net government expenditures compared to their potential growth rates (which is used as part of the expenditure 
benchmark criterion under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact). In addition, potential output can also be relevant for evaluating the sustainability 
and effectiveness of different structural reform agendas, aimed at boosting the productive capacity of individual EU countries.

The EUCAM software is an open source program which has been developed thanks to the collaboration of DG ECFIN and the Joint Research Centre of the European 
Commission. Its release is an important step in enhancing the user-friendliness of the EU's output gap estimation methodology.

The EUCAM software is used to calculate the official EC output gap and potential output estimates since Spring 2021. It aims at streamlining the estimation of the 
economic indicators used in the calculations and at making the process more transparent. Regarding the first aim, it provides a common graphical user interface
which allows users to control each step of the calculation process. Regarding the transparency goal, the EUCAM software relies entirely on open source technology
with publicly released code, allowing outside contributions to be considered in terms of the future development of the software.

INSTALLATION
------------
The main folder contains the Python code that allows to execute the software using a Python interpreter. In that case the program interface 'EUCAMv1 - 
interpreted.xlsm' must be used. We use Python 3.8 64 bit and Python libraries listed in 'requirements.txt'. Before running the program please sprecify the complete Python interpreter path in cell B9 of Sheet 'Source files'.

INSTALLER_FILE contains an installer that will allow to install a compiled version of the program (EUCAMv1.exe).
NO NEED in this case for Python interpreter installation.
